    <h1 id="elektra-s-privacy-policy-v0-1-">Elektra&#39;s Privacy Policy (V0.1)</h1>
    <p>This is a placeholder, and will for the time being work as a letter of intent.
        As stated on the homepage, registered users will be notified by email when this policity changes.</p>
    <h2 id="general">General</h2>
    <p>Elektra will not be sharing your data with anyone â€“ with some critical exceptions. These exceptions include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Legal matters, where we&#39;re required to provide identifying data. E.g:<ul>
                <li>Insurance cases</li>
                <li>Cooperating with police or other governmental bodies</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The data is anonymized, for use in PR</li>
        <li>You have personally opted-in (public-feature)<ul>
                <li>Note: this is currently disabled</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>A user can at any point have their data deleted, though keep in mind that this will remove their access to the
        office and sponsored events.</p>
    <p>Access to Elekra&#39;s server where data is saved is strictly limited to the leader of TekKom. Responsibility
        remains with the leader of TekKom if the data leaves the server for any reason.</p>
    <h2 id="technical">Technical</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Passwords are not stored in cleartext. They&#39;re all individually hashed using the trusted bcrypt-library,
            and all have their own unique &quot;salt&quot;.<ul>
                <li>In layman&#39;s terms, this means that no-one can view your password</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
    </ul>
    <h2 id="open-source">Open Source</h2>
    <p>The website is going to be open-sourced in the coming months, when TekKom gets time.</p>
